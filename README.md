## Hi there 👋

I'm Tan, a Frontend Developer who never stops learning, with a long-term goal of becoming a Fullstack Developer.

My journey into web development did not start from my original major.
Everything I know today comes from self-learning, curiosity, and continuous practice.

My main stack is HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (currently focusing on strengthening frontend fundamentals before moving deeper into backend technologies).

I’ve built several websites during my learning journey. One of my favorite projects is JPRestaurant.

**Fun facts:**

I have a cat named Knight 🐈

I’m addicted to coffee ☕

Passionate about sports 🏃‍♂️

Always open to relocation for work opportunities
